# Calculator
A simple calculator app built with vanilla JavaScript.

This was part of an assignment for The Odin Project's Foundations of Web Development course. It was a fun way of putting together everything I'd learned up to that point, even if the actual code came out a little messy.

This was also the first project I published on GitHub Pages. Check out the live view [here!]()
